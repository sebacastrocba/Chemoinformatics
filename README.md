# Molecular design aided by machine learning of potent trypanocidal agents as cruzipain inhibitors 

The present project addresses the search for molecules with potential utility for the treatment of Chagas disease. Among all posible targets, Cruzipain is a well established one for the identification of new antichagasic agents. Here, based on different types of molecular descriptors and machine learning models, I developed models to accurately acquire highly potent cruzipain inhibitors.
